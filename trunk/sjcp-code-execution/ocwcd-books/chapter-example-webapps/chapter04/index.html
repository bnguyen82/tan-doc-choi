<center><h3> Chapter 04 - The Servlet Model </h3></center>
In this chapter, we talk about the basic concepts of the Servlet model. This web application contains the following two examples from the chapter. 

<ol>
<li><a href="httpmethodtest.html">This</a> page shows the triggers that cause the browser to send HTTP GET and POST requests. It also shows how to retrieve servlet initialization parameters.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>This web application also implements the simple banking application explained in section 4.8.3. Here is the <a href="/chapter04/login.html">Login page</a> for the application<br>
As explained in Listing 4.9, the usernames/passwords are hard coded in the LoginServlet. You can use any of the following values:<br>
1. ann/aaa<br>
2. john/jjj<br>
3. mark/mmm<br>
<br>
Once you login, you should see the account information of the user.
